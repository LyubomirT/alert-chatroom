## How Can I Contribute?

There are lots of ways to contribute to Alert:

- üêõ **Report bugs**: If you find a bug, let us know! Open an issue and describe what you encountered.
- üí° **Suggest enhancements**: Have an idea to make Alert better? We'd love to hear it! Open an issue with your suggestion.
- üìù **Improve documentation**: Good docs make everyone's life easier. If you see something that could be clearer, go ahead and update it.
- üíª **Write code**: Ready to dive into the codebase? Check out our open issues and see if there's something you'd like to tackle.

## Style Guidelines

We try to keep our code clean and consistent. Here are a few guidelines:

- Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- Use camelCase for variable and function names.
- Keep lines under 80 characters when possible.
- Comment your code, but remember that good code is self-documenting.

For JavaScript specifics, we follow the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) with a few tweaks. When in doubt, look at existing code and try to match the style.

## Commit Messages

Good commit messages make everyone's life easier. Try to follow these guidelines:

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

For example:
```
Add emoji reaction feature

- Implement emoji picker
- Add reaction display to messages
- Update database schema to store reactions

Closes #123
```

## Pull Requests

Ready to submit your changes? Awesome! Here's what to do:

1. Make sure your code follows our style guidelines.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, if applicable.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent.
4. Submit a pull request to the `main` branch of the original Alert repository.

We'll review your pull request as soon as we can. We might ask for some changes or improvements to be made before we can merge it.
