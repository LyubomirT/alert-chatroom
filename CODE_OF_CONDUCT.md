# Code of Conduct

## Hey there, Alert community! 👋

We're all about creating a welcoming and positive space for everyone. To make sure we're all on the same page, we've put together this Code of Conduct. It's pretty simple stuff, but it helps keep things running smoothly.

## The Short Version

Be cool, be kind, and respect others. Easy, right?

## The Slightly Longer Version

### 1. Be Inclusive 🌈

We welcome everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### 2. Be Respectful 🤝

We might not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior. Be respectful in your conversations and interactions. Remember, there's a human on the other side of the screen.

### 3. Choose Your Words Wisely 💬

Be kind to others. No harassment or hate speech, please. This includes:

- Mean or insulting comments
- Personal or political attacks
- Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### 4. Give Credit Where It's Due 🏆

Respect intellectual property rights. Don't pass off other people's work as your own.

### 5. Keep It Legal 🚫

Don't use Alert for anything illegal. That includes sharing copyrighted material without permission.

### 6. Be Helpful 🤗

We're all here to learn and grow. If you can help someone out, go for it!

## What Happens If Someone Breaks the Rules?

If someone's behavior is making you uncomfortable, let us know. We take these things seriously. Depending on the situation, we might:

- Give a friendly reminder about the Code of Conduct
- Issue a warning
- Temporarily ban someone from the community
- Permanently ban someone from the community

## Let's Make Alert Awesome Together!

By following these guidelines, we can keep Alert a fun, welcoming place for everyone. Thanks for being part of our community and helping to make it great!

Remember, if you see something that doesn't look right, say something. You can always reach out to the project maintainers.

Happy chatting, everyone! 🎉
